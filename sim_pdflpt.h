/* Emulated device-independent interface to lpt2pdf for SimH
 *
 * Resources:
 *   UNIT up8 is used for PDF context. A printer that uses it will have
 *   to relocate to another spot.
 *   
 * This is (except for attach) a fairly thin wrapper around lpt2pdf's API.
 * It allows a printer simulator to output either text (as always) or 
 * PDF files.  In the latter case it gets the look and behavior of real paper.
 *
 * There is a lot of documentation.  But typical use (user and developer)
 * is actually quite simple.  Don't get intimidated by the detail.
 *
 * The choice is made by the user at ATTACH time.  The simulated device need
 * only replace its attach/detach and output functions with those provided here.
 *
 * The output functions replace fputc, fputs and fwrite - though the argument order
 * matches simh conventions.  The only special characters (at present) that cause
 * pdf processing are:
 *   o <FF> \f  - Advance to the next page
 *   o <LF> \n  - Print the current line.  (This also resets the active position to column 1.)
 *   o <CR> \r  - Resets the active position to column 1.  (Overstrike works.)
 * Future versions MAY interpret some ANSI escape sequences, so <ESC> \033
 * is also reserved.  (This might enable access to additional characters.)
 *
 * The device emulator (still) is responsible for emulating
 * vertical tab, carriage control tapes, and any other functions.
 *
 * For updating the file position, a function is provided that is analogous to
 * ftell - but it returns a page number, not a file position.  File position is
 * meaningless in a .pdf file, and is not exported.  The line number is also
 * available if the device wants to provide detailed progress.
 *
 * ATTACH can be as simple as ATTACH LPT0 file.pdf.  But if one wants non-default
 * forms, pitch, etc, it gets a bit longer.  ATTACH LPT0 FORM=BLUEBAR file.pdf.
 *
 * Most devices don't do much with errors, but there are also functions for 
 * getting the last PDF error, turning error codes into strings, etc.
 *
 * Unlike text files, .PDF files can not be "tail"ed while being written.  DETACH is the
 * only way to get a consistent, readable file.  ATTACH wil render it unreadable
 * (by PDF readers).  If you use pdflpt_flush, the file will be in a consistent state
 * until the next output.  However, (if you're lucky) your OS will have an update
 * lock on it to prevent the reader from getting confused.
 */

/* Updating your device:
 *
 * There are two methods: The simple method and the advanced method.
 *
 * A) Simple method:
 *    If your device follows the standard template and is not creative, the upgrade
 *    requires 4 lines of code, two at the top of your module, AFTER the other #includes:
 *       #define PDFLPT_REPLACE_STDIO
 *       #include "sim_pdflpt.h"
 *    and two in the help function:  (What, no help function?  You're done!)
 *        fprintf (st, "If the disk file is named .pdf, the output will be in PDF format on greenbar paper.\n");
 *        fprintf (st, "The PDF output is customizable; see the general documentation.\n");
 *    You also need to add sim_pdflpt.c and lpt2pdf.c to your machine's Makefile (or equivalent).
 *
 *    This method assumes that the only use of <stdio.h> functions is for writing to your device; that the
 *    device doesn't uses fprintf (note how HELP does), and that the unit pointer has the default name "uptr".
 *
 * B) Advanced method:
 *    If you have the time, your code will be more maintainable if you use this method (redefining standard
 *    library functions is ugly, and potentially fattening.)  Or if you don't meet the requirements for the
 *    Simple method.  This will always work:
 *
 *    #include "sim_pdflpt.h"
 *
 *    Make sure that sim_pdflpt.c and lpt2pdf.c are in your Makefile or equivalent.
 *
 *    point your device ATTACH & DETACH functions to pdflpt_attach/pdflpt_detach.  (If they are more
 *    involved than attach_unit and detach_unit, replace the calls in the custom functions.)
 *
 *    Find the functions that write to the output file, and replace them with the
 *    corresponding call(s) to pdflpt_putc, pdflpt_puts and/or pdflpt_write.  If there is an opportunity
 *    to output more than one character per call (pdflpt_puts or pdflpt_write), it is advisable
 *    to use it.  The PDF API is optimized for handling longer amounts of output.
 *
 *    Replace any calls to update the file position (typically, unit.pos = ftell (unit.fileref)
 *    with a call to pdflpt_where.  Be aware that the result is NOT seekable in PDF output.
 *
 *    Replace (or remove) any other references to unit.fileref.  flush can be replaced by pdflpt_flush.
 *    fseek() is unnecessary - but if you need it for some reason, call pdflpt_getmode and skip it for
 *    PDF files.  pdflpt_attach will position non-PDF files at EOF for you.
 *
 *    Update the device help.
 *
 *    If you don't do anything special with errors (e.g. you just reflect them as SCPE_IOERR),
 *    you're done.  If you do, look at the error functions.  The error codes are defined in
 *    lpt2pdf.h.
 *
 *    If your printer is expected to stay attached for a long time, you may want to consider setting a
 *    timer to call pdflpt_flush when the printer has been idle for a while.  See pdp10_lp20 for a sample
 *    of this technique.
 *
 * - And, of course whichever method you choose, test!

/* Replacements for attach_unit and detach_unit that handle PDF magic.
 * These defer to the standard routines if pdf output is not selected.
 */

/* Attach function for LPTs
 *
 * If the supplied filename ends with .pdf, the data will, barring errors,
 * be converted to PDF.  Otherwise, it's treated as a standard attach, and
 * output will be whatever the device supplies - usually raw ascii.
 *
 * To provide the PDF parameters without adding set and show commands, they
 * are encoded in the filename string, before the filename.  The syntax is:
 *      attach -switches unit par=value par=value ... filespec.pdf
 * No parameters or switches are required.
 *
 * PDF mode switches:
 *   -N - A new file is created, or an existing one overwritten
 *   -E - File must exist (and be a .pdf file)
 *   -R - If the file exists, must be empty
 *   None - If the file exists, data will be appended.  If not, will be created.
 *
 * Note that a .pdf file must be properly closed; a simulator crash will
 * likely corrupt a file.
 *
 * Parameters:     Default
 *   Parameter      Value       Description
 *   FORM         GREENBAR      Form to be printed: PLAIN, GREENBAR, BLUEBAR, YELLOWBAR, GRAYBAR

 *   TITLE    Lineprinter data  Title of PDF document
 *   FONT     Courier           Font for text; must be PDF standard, monospace.
 *   TOP-MARGIN     1.0in       Space above first bar; start of normal print area
 *   BOTTOM-MARGIN  0.5in       Space below last bar; end of normal print area
