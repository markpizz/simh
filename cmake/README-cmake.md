## Intended Audience: Developers

This document assumes that you, the reader, are a knowledgeable software developer:

  - You have a C/C++ compiler installed on your host or virtual machine
  - You know how to develop and build software artifacts (executables, shared
    objects, dynamically linked libraries).
  - You can install software development dependencies on your host or virtual machine.
    - Linux and *nix platforms: You know how to use `rpm`, `apt`, `pacman` or the appropriate
      package manager your Linux or *nix uses.
    - Windows: You use a package manager such as [Scoop][scoop] or [Chocolatey][chocolatey],
      or you are comfortable with installing software directly.
  - You known what tools such as `make`, `bison` and `flex` do.
  - You can diagnose your software development environment's issues/problems.
  
If you are not a reasonably knowledgeable software developer or are new to software
development, _PLEASE USE THE PRE-COMPILED SIMULATORS_. 

_Windows developers_: This document distinctly prefers the [Scoop][scoop]
package manager. While this is the author's preference, it does not have to be
yours. You always have the option to use another package manager, such as
[Chocolatey][chocolatey], or direct software installation from the package's
download site. If you use another package manager or directly install software,
you're ultimately responsible for diagnosing issues with your software
development environment.

## Why CMake?

[CMake][cmake] is a cross-platform "meta" build system that provides similar
functionality to GNU _autotools_ within a more integrated and platform-agnostic
framework. A sample of the supported build environments include:

  - Unix Makefiles
  - [MinGW Makefiles][mingw64]
  - [Ninja][ninja]
  - MS Visual Studio solutions (2015, 2017, 2019)
  - IDE build wrappers ([Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) and [CodeBlocks](http://www.codeblocks.org))

[CMake][cmake] is not intended to supplant, supercede or replace the existing
`simh` build infrastructure.  If you like the existing `makefile` "poor man's
configure" approach, there's nothing to stop you from using it. [CMake][cmake]
is a parallel build system to the `simh` `makefile` and is just another way to 
build `simh`'s simulators.

## Building `simh` With CMake

### Before You Begin: Prerequisites

#### Supported C Compilers

| Compiler                 | Notes                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| _GNU C Compiler (gcc)_   | This is one of two compilers against which `simh` is routinely compiled. `gcc` is the default compiler for many Linux and *nix platforms; it can also be used for [Mingw-w64][mingw64]-based builds on Windows. |
| _Microsoft Visual C/C++_ | This is the other compiler against which `simh` is routinely compiled. |
| _CLang/LLVM_             | Building `simh` with `clang` and [CMake][cmake] is untested. It will probably work on Linux and *nix platforms without issues. This is completely untested on Windows. |

Your mileage may vary on other platforms where [CMake][cmake] is supported.

#### Tool and Library Dependencies

The table below lists the development tools and packages needed to build the
`simh` simulators, with corresponding `apt`, `rpm` and `Scoop` package names,
where available. Blank names indicate that the package is not offered via the
respective package manager.

| Prerequisite             | Category   | `apt` package   | `rpm` package  | [Scoop][scoop] package | Notes  |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | --------------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | :----: |
| [CMake][cmake]           | Dev. tool  | cmake           | cmake          | cmake                  | (1)    |
| [Git][gitscm]            | Dev. tool  | git             | git            | git                    | (1, 2) |
| [Npcap][npcap]           | Runtime    |                 |                |                        | (3)    |
| [zlib][zlib]             | Dependency | zlib1g-dev      | zlib-devel     |                        | (4)    |
| [pcre2][pcre2]           | Dependency | libpcre2-dev    | pcre2-devel    |                        | (4)    |
| [libpng][libpng]         | Dependency | libpng-dev      | libpng-devel   |                        | (4)    |
| [FreeType][FreeType]     | Dependency | libfreetype-dev | freetype-devel |                        | (4)    |
| [libpcap][libpcap]       | Dependency | libpcap-dev     | libpcap-devel  |                        | (4)    |
| [SDL2][SDL2]             | Dependency | libsdl2-dev     | SDL2-devel     |                        | (4)    |
| [SDL_ttf][SDL2_ttf]      | Dependency | libsdl2-ttf-dev |                |                        | (4)    |
| [pthreads4w][pthreads4w] | Dependency |                 |                |                        | (5)    |

_Notes_:

(1) Required development tool.

(2) Tool might already be installed on your system.

(3) [Npcap][npcap] is a Windows packet capture device driver. It is a runtime requirement used by simulators that emulate native Ethernet networking
    on Windows.

(4) If the package name is blank or you do not have the package installed, the `simh` [CMake][cmake] build process will download and compile the
    library dependency from source. [Scoop][scoop] does not provide these development library dependencies, so all dependencies will be built from
    source on Windows. Similarly, `SDL_ttf` support may not be available for RPM package-based systems (RedHat, CentOS, ArchLinux, ...), but will
    be compiled from source.

(5) [pthreads4w][pthreads4w] provides POSIX `pthreads` API using a native Windows implementation. This dependency is built only when using the
    _Visual Studio_ compiler. [Mingw-w64][mingw64] provides a `pthreads` library as a part of the `gcc` compiler toolchain.

### Building `simh`

It is basically up to you to choose the build system with which you're most comfortable and probably already use. [CMake][cmake] generates the files and
environment for your preferred build system from the `CMakeFiles.txt` configuration file. [CMake Generators](#cmake-generators) has more information
about which build systems your [CMake][cmake] installation supports.

The process to build `simh` with [CMake][cmake] follows the steps below:

1. Clone the `simh` Git repository, if you haven't done so already.
2. Create a subdirectory in which you will build the simulators.
 
    _Note_: This [CMake][cmake] configuration **will not allow you** to configure, build or compile `simh` in the source
    tree. Building `simh` simulators with [CMake][cmake] ***must*** be done in a separate directory, which is usually a
    subdirectory within the source tree. An informal convention for subdirectory names is `cmake-<something>`, e.g.,
    `cmake-unix` for Unix Makefile builds and `cmake-ninja` for [Ninja][ninja]-based builds (`.gitignore` ignores all
    subdirectories that start with `cmake-`.) To keep the generated files related to building simh out of the general
    source tree, it is suggested that `BIN/cmake-{generator}` is the best place to build in.

3. Compile the dependencies
  - Detect which dependencies need to be built
  - Generate the build environment to build the dependencies (if any)
  - Build dependencies (if any)
4. Compile the simulators
  - Configure and generate the build environment for the simulators
  - Build the simulators

#### Linux/*nix platforms

The following shell 

``` shell
# Install Ubuntu/Linux dependencies
$ sudo apt install cmake zlib1g-dev libpcre-dev libpng-dev libpcap-dev libsdl2-dev libfreetype6-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev

# Clone the simh repository (if you haven't done so already)
$ git clone  https://github.com/simh/simh.git simh
$ cd simh

# make a build directory and generate Unix Makefiles
$ mkdir -p BIN/cmake-unix
$ cd BIN/cmake-unix
$ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../../cmake

# First time around, d/l and build dependency libraries, if they're
# not found (usually the case on Windows, YMMV on *nix):
$ cmake --build . --config Release

# Second time around: Reconfigure using the newly built dependency libraries
# and build simh's simulators
$ cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../../cmake
$ cmake --build . --config Release

# Alternatively, you can go into your favorite IDE and build from within your
# IDE. Or, with the Ninja build system, you could just type `ninja` instead of
# `cmake --build . --configure Release`. Or if you used "Unix Makefiles", you
# could just type `make`. (See the pattern yet?)

# Oh, so you want to run stuff? From inside the build?
# Need to add the build-stage/bin directory to your PATH:
$ PATH=`pwd`/build-stage/bin:$PATH

# For Windows Powershell:
# $env:PATH="$(Get-Location)\build-stage\bin;$env:PATH"

# Run the vax simulator from inside the build:
$ ./vax

# Install will install to the `BIN` directory inside the source tree:
$ cmake --install .
```

### Configuration Options

The default `simh` [CMake][cmake] configuration is _"Batteries Included"_: all
options are enabled. The configuration options for `simh-cmake` generally
mirror those in the `makefile`:

* `WITH_NETWORK`: Enable (=1)/disable (=0) simulator networking support. (def: enabled)
* `WITH_VIDEO`: Enable (=1)/disable (=0) simulator display and graphics support (def: enabled)
* `PANDA_LIGHTS`: Enable (=1)/disable (=0) KA-10/KI-11 simulator's Panda display. (def: disabled)
* `DONT_USE_ROMS`: Enable (=1)/disable (=0) building hardcoded support ROMs. (def: disabled)
* `ENABLE_CPPCHECK`: Enable (=1)/disable (=0) [cppcheck][cppcheck] static code checking rules.

[CMake][cmake] enables (or disables) options at configuration time:

```shell
# Assuming that you are in the cmake-ninja build subdirectory already.
# Remove the CMakeCache.txt file if you are reconfiguring your build system:
$ rm -f CMakeCache.txt

# Then reconfigure:
$ cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_NETWORK=Off -DENABLE_CPPCHECK=Off

# Alteratively ("0" and "Off" are equivalent)
$ cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_NETWORK=0 -DENABLE_CPPCHECK=0
```

### CMake quickstart

`simh-cmake` is a `CMake` "_superbuild_": It first downloads and builds
dependency libraries (SDL2, SDL2-ttf, pcre, zlib, freetype, ...), if they are
missing. These dependency libraries are staged in the `CMake` build directory.
Once all of the dependency libraries are satisfied, you reconfigure
`simh-cmake` to build the simulators. Unless you nuke the build directory, you
should only have to build the dependency libraries once.

```shell
# clone (if you haven't done so already)
$ git clone  https://github.com/simh/simh.git simh
$ cd simh

# make a build directory and generate a build environment (ex: Ninja on Windows 10)
$ mkdir -p BIN/cmake-ninja
$ cd BIN/cmake-ninja
$ cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../../cmake

# First time around, d/l and build dependency libraries, if they're
# not found (usually the case on Windows, YMMV on *nix):
$ cmake --build . --config Release

# Second time around: Reconfigure using the newly built dependency libraries
# and build simh's simulators
$ cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ../../cmake
$ cmake --build . --config Release

# Alternatively, you can go into your favorite IDE and build from within your
# IDE. Or, with the Ninja build system, you could just type `ninja` instead of
# `cmake --build . --configure Release`. Or if you used "Unix Makefiles", you
# could just type `make`. (See the pattern yet?)

# Oh, so you want to run stuff? From inside the build?
# Need to add the build-stage/bin directory to your PATH:
$ PATH=`pwd`/build-stage/bin:$PATH

# For Windows Powershell:
# $env:PATH="$(Get-Location)\build-stage\bin;$env:PATH"

# Run the vax simulator from inside the build:
$ ./vax

# Install will install to the `BIN` directory inside the source tree:
$ cmake --install .
```

### Notes for Windows Visual Studio

The source tree versions of the Visual Studio project files/solutions build a
32-bit executable. To do this with [CMake][cmake], you have to specify the target
architecture at confiugration time as follows:

``` shell
# Visual Studio 2019 has an argument for architecture, "-A", and defaults
# to a 64-bit architecture:
PS> cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A Win32 ../../cmake

# Prior Visual Studios don't and default to Win32
PS> cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" ../../cmake
PS> cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" ../../cmake
PS> cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013" ../../cmake
PS> cmake -G "Visual Studio 11 2012" ../../cmake
PS> cmake -G "Visual Studio 10 2010" ../../cmake
PS> cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" ../../cmake
```

## `CMake` Generators

[CMake][cmake] generates environments for a wide variety of build systems. The available list of build systems in your installed [CMake][cmake] is always available via:

``` shell
$ cmake --help
# (Some help text elided here for brevity...)

## Developer Notes

### Build Directories

The `simh` [CMake][cmake]-based build infrastructure _does not support_ source tree
builds. All builds have to occur outside of the source tree. The name of the
build directory is not significant and does not have to be a subdirectory within
the source tree.  If it is within the source tree, it is recommended that
it be done in a sub directory of the BIN directory which is where all generated
files are contained and are specifically ignored by git.

As a matter of convention, however, build subdirectories tend to have the form
`cmake-<build system>`, e.g., `cmake-ninja` for a [Ninja][ninja] build or
`cmake-vs2019` for a Visual Studio 2019 build. You can have as many of these
build subdirectories as you deem necessary. _Note_: you need to be careful
about your `PATH` environment variable when running simulators from within the
build directory.

The build directory has the following structure:

```
cmake-ninja
|- CMakeCache.txt               # CMake cache: Remove to completely reconfigure
|- build-stage                  # Staging area for dependencies
|  |- bin                       # Dependency executables and DLLs
|  |- include                   # Headers
|  |- lib                       # Libraries
|  |- man
|  |- share
|- 3b2{.exe}                    # 3b2 simulator executabe
|- ...                          # 3b2 build products
|- {simulator}.exe						  # simulator executables
```

### `add_simulator`: Compiling simulators

If you hack the simulators and add (or remove) source files, you should 
adjust the simh makefile to cleanly build your changes and then regenerate
your desired cmake configuration.  The generated cmake configuration lands
in the build directory called simh_makefile.cmake and leverages the
add_simulator function described below.

The `add_simulator` function sets up the individual simulator executable. For
example, in the `3B2` `CMakeLists.txt`, the 3b2 simulator's executable
`add_simulator` looks like:

``` cmake
add_simulator(3b2
    SOURCES
        3b2_cpu.c 
        3b2_mmu.c
        3b2_iu.c 
        3b2_if.c
        3b2_id.c 
        3b2_dmac.c
        3b2_sys.c 
        3b2_io.c
        3b2_ports.c
        3b2_ctc.c
        3b2_ni.c 
        3b2_mau.c
        3b2_sysdev.c
    INCLUDES
	    3B2
    FULL64
    BUILDROMS)
```

- `add_simulator`'s first argument is the simulator's executable name: `3b2`.
  This generates an executable named `3b2` on *nix platforms or `3b2.exe` on
  Windows platforms.
  
- Argument list keywords: `SOURCES`, `INCLUDES`, `DEFINES`
    - `SOURCES` enumerates the source files that comprise the simulator. The
      file names are relative to the simulator's source directory. In the
      `3b2`'s case, this is relative to the `3B2/` subdirectory where
      `3B2/CMakeLists.txt` is located.
    - `INCLUDES` enumerates the include directories where the header files
      needed by the simulator are located, i.e., subdirectories that follow the
      compiler's `-I` flag). These subdirectories are relative to the top level
      `simh` directory.
    - `DEFINES` enumerates command line manifest constants, i.e., values that
      follow the compiler's `-D` flags.

- Option keywords:
  - `INT64`: 64-bit integers, 32-bit pointers
  - `FULL64`: 64-bit integers, 64-bit pointers
  - `BUILDROMS`: Simulator depends on the `BuildROMs` utility to build the
    built-in boot ROMs.
  - `VIDEO`: Simulator video support.

Putting it all together:

``` cmake
add_simulator(my_simulator
    SOURCES
        my_sim.c
        my_sim_devs.c
        my_sim_support.c
    INCLUDES
        my_simulator                # Relative to the top-level source directory
        ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/PDP8    # Add top-level PDP8 subdirectory, explicit path
        VAX/                        # Add top-level VAX subdirectory
    DEFINES
        VM_SIMH_SIMULATOR
        SPECIAL_VALUE=0xdeadbeef
    INT64                           # 64-bit integer, 32-bit pointer option
    FULL64                          # 64-bit integer, 64-bit pointer option
    BUILDROMS                       # Boot ROM is built-in header file
    VIDEO                           # Video support
)
```


## Motivation

**Note**: This is personal opinion. There are many personal opinions like this,
but this one is mine (B. Scott Michel).

`simh` is a difficult package to build from scratch, especially if you're on a
Windows platform. There's a separate directory tree that resides parallel to 
the main `simh` codebase (aka `sim-master`.) It's an approach that I've used 
in the past and it's hard to maintain (viz. a recent commit log entry that 
says that `git` forks should _not_ fork the `windows-build` subdirectory.) 
In my That's not a particularly clean or intuitive way of building software. 
It's also prone to errors and doesn't lend itself to upgrading dependency 
libraries.
